h1. Selenium Tests

h2. Identifying a row

The tr element in a datatable has an attribute record_id containing the instance's id.
This is not true for rows added by a call to the datatable's method addRow().

h2. Identifying a data cell

We can identify the column with its class, which is of the form 

yui-dt0-col-#{detail_name}

The presence of a cell can be checked with an AssertElementPresent with an argument of this form:

td[contains(@class,"yui-dt0-col-name")]/div[@class="yui-dt-liner" and .="Mr 64K"]

h2. Identifying action columns in a datatable

We can identify the column with its class,which is of the form
  "yui-dt0-col-#{action_name}"

Additionally, the instance id is put in the image's record_id attribute.
So, to click the delete icon of the instance with id 203, you would do this:

//td[contains(@class, 'yui-dt0-col-delete')]/div/img[@record_id='203']
