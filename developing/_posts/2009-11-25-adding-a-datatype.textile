We are using YUI datatable, and so the data displayed in the table is formatted with a javascript function.
If this function needs to have access to the detail_value_id of the detail_value, be sure to serialize the value column such as it is done for the file_attachment.


detail instance calls yui_column (which returns the javascript code of the hash), which calls DetailValue.yui_formatter (which returns the javascript code of the formatter).
options passed to the methods are:
* the controller (giving access to url_for)
